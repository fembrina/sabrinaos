# Trigger this script on two events:
# 1. When code is pushed to main (to update history)
# 2. When a Pull Request targets main (the Gatekeeper)
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

    steps:
    # Step 1: Download your code
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Install the toolchain
    # We need NASM for assembly and gcc-multilib for 32-bit compilation
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y nasm gcc-multilib build-essential qemu-system-x86

    # Step 3: Run your Makefile
    # This runs the 'all' target. If it returns exit code 0, Green Check.
    # If GCC throws an error/warning, it returns exit code 1, Red X.

      run: make

    # Step 4: Verify the output exists
    # Just a sanity check to ensure the file was actually created
